# Real Estate Analytics, Prediction, and Recommender System

## Overview

This project is designed to provide real estate insights, price predictions, and personalized recommendations using several machine learning and data analysis modules. The system consists of five core modules:

1. **Analytics Module**
2. **Price Prediction Module**
3. **Recommender System Module**
4. **Insights Module**
5. **Deployment**

## 1. Analytics Module

The Analytics Module is designed to visualize and provide exploratory data analysis (EDA) for real estate data. It includes the following components:

### a. Spatial Analysis
- **Description**: This feature analyzes geographical distributions of properties.
- **Output**: Spatial plots showing the distribution of real estate properties by location.

### b. Price Distribution Across Sectors
- **Description**: Displays the distribution of property prices across different sectors or regions.
- **Output**: Bar charts or histograms representing price ranges in each sector.

### c. Price vs. Square Foot Analysis
- **Description**: A comparative analysis of property prices against the area (square footage) of properties.
- **Output**: Scatter plots or regression lines showing the relationship between price and square footage.

### d. Number of Rooms Pie Chart
- **Description**: Visualizes the distribution of the number of rooms in properties.
- **Output**: A pie chart showing the proportion of properties based on the number of rooms.

### e. Top Feature Word Cloud
- **Description**: Generates a word cloud based on the most frequently mentioned features or amenities in property descriptions.
- **Output**: Word cloud visualization highlighting the prominent features.

## 2. Price Prediction Module

This module uses machine learning models to predict the price of properties based on various features such as location, area, number of rooms, and other attributes. 

### Features:
- **Inputs**: Property details like location, size, features, etc.
- **Model**: A trained machine learning model (e.g., Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Network).
- **Outputs**: Predicted property prices based on input features.

## 3. Recommender System Module

The Recommender System Module provides personalized property recommendations based on user preferences and previous interactions.

### Features:
- **Input**: User preferences, previous searches, or selected properties.
- **Algorithm**: Collaborative filtering or content-based recommendation algorithms.
- **Output**: A list of recommended properties that match the user's preferences.

## 5. Deployment

The project can be deployed to various environments such as:

- **Cloud-based Platforms**: Deployment on cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure for scalability and accessibility.
- **Web Application**: Integrated into a web-based dashboard where users can interact with the modules in real-time.
- **Docker**: Containerized deployment using Docker for easy setup and portability.

### Dependencies
- Python (3.x)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anup-repo/real-estate-analysis.git
   cd repo_name
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

1. **Run the application locally**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Access the web-based dashboard**:
   Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

3. **Modules**:
   - Use the analytics dashboard to view spatial and price analysis.
   - Upload property data for price predictions.
   - Interact with the recommender system to get property suggestions.
